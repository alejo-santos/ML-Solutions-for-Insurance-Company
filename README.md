**Project Overview: Machine Learning Solutions for Insurance Company**

An insurance company seeks to leverage machine learning to address several key business challenges. Your task is to evaluate the feasibility of applying machine learning techniques to achieve the following objectives:

- **Task 1: Customer Similarity Identification**
  Develop a solution to identify customers with profiles similar to a specified customer. This tool will assist marketing agents in creating targeted campaigns and enhancing customer engagement.

- **Task 2: Predicting Insurance Benefit Eligibility**
  Build a predictive model to assess whether a new customer is likely to qualify for insurance benefits. The goal is to outperform a baseline (dummy) model in terms of predictive accuracy.

- **Task 3: Estimating the Number of Insurance Benefits**
  Using a linear regression model, predict the number of insurance benefits a new customer may receive. This will help the company forecast resource allocation and improve service delivery.

- **Task 4: Data Protection Through Masking**
  Implement a data transformation algorithm to protect sensitive customer information (data masking) while maintaining the integrity of the predictive model from Task 3. The objective is to ensure that if data were to be exposed, it would be difficult to recover personal information without degrading the modelâ€™s performance.
